## About

CultureHub workshop for students from Seoul visiting NYC. Focus on performance and media and transcending borders / barriers. 

## Workshop Topics

1. Portfolio: Intersection of the body and technology
2. Kinectron: The body as interface in creative coding
3. Facing You / Kinectron: Telepresence and the physical body 

## Portfolio

### Three Working Themes 

1. Alternative inputs to motion capture — sensors
2. Embodiment in the third virtual space — Myron Krueger 
3. How do computers see our bodies — glitches and creative computing

## Kinectron 

### Microsoft Kinect 

The Microsoft Kinect is an inexpensive motion capture camera originally created for use with Xbox. It was quickly adopted by artists. There are two versions released in 2010 and 2013. It has infrared, color and depth cameras, and it (Kinect V2) can detect up to six human skeletons in three-dimensional space. Microsoft officially announced it was discountinuing the Kinect in October 2017.

#### About Kinectron

Kinectron is an open source tool that brings realtime, motion capture data into the browser. Kinectron has two components—an electron application to broadcast Kinect2 data over a peer connection, and a client-side API to request and receive that data over a peer connection. Kinectron connects to creative coding frameworks like P5.js and three.js. It is node based, and it builds on the Node Kinect2 and PeerJS libraries.

#### Getting Started — p5.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a creative coding library created by [Lauren McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/) and is developed by a communicty of collaborators. It is based on the creative coding library, Processing, and allows for interesting interactive graphics on websites.
